# GPIO_External_Interrupts
This repository has three applications using GPIO External Interrupts on STM32F401RE.
## Introduction
These projects were developed as a work in the discipline of Embedded Systems Programming at UFMG - Prof. Ricardo de Oliveira Duarte - Department of Electronic Engineering.

## EXTI_priority
This application describes how to set preemptive priority levels to interrupts. It consists of two push buttons, which will make a LED blink 5 times, but each of them will provide a different blinking frequency for the LED.
